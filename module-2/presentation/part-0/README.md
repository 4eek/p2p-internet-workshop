# Recap from last week

Using `Raspberry Pis`, we formed a `wireless mesh network` and shared messages between them using a `content-addressed` `peer-to-peer` file system.

_Last week the mesh network formed autonomously once we turned on the Raspberry Pis. Today we will manually form the mesh network._
