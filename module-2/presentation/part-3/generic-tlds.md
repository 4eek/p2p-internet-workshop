# Generic TLDs

Starting around 2000, started adding new gTLDs beyond the six "original" domains and in 2012 opened up a process through which companies can apply to establish new gTLDs for a fee. So people started registering things like:

- `.cat` `.scot` : Secessionist domains representing a non-recognized nation-states or cultural entities.
- `.accenture` : Brand recognition domains.
- `.sucks` : Contentious use domains.
