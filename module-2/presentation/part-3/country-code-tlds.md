# Country-code TLDs

ccTLDs are associated with countries and they are managed by a national telecommunications authority or "partner" with companies that manage the domain and pay out royalties to countries. What happens when...

- `.tv` `.io` : Sweet country code but lacks infrastructure to benefit from the domain?
- `.ly` `.yu` : Country is in political unrest or breaks apart altogether?
- `vb.ly` : Domain name use does not reflect the country's politics and culture?
