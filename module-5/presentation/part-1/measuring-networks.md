Measuring networks provides a single point in time calculation of an attribute of a network.

## Why do we measure networks.

* What is expected of our network and what is the reality?
* How can we improve the network.
* Is the user experiance acceptable?

## Monitoring as a form of long term measuring

* Monitoring networks provides a constan measurment
* Most monitoring suites provide
  * Means of collecting measurement results (Push or Poll)
  * Means of storing this data for a long period of time
  * Means of querying or viewing the data collected

## Push or Poll

### Push
* Push provide event driven information
* Nodes must be operational
* Usualy only one node provides access to the information

### Poll
* Monitoring service requests information from each device
* More consistent information is provided
* When a node is none responsive you get feedback of that
* Uses more bandwith
