# Speed test

Using [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net), run a speed test with available public WiFi:

- Run speed test from a single device
- Run speed test from two devices simultaneously
- Run speed test from several devices simultaneously

If the speed test is using the full internet connection, each additional user running a speed test should cut the speed for everyone. If it does not, it could indicate:

- Wireless bottleneck
- Server bottleneck
- Per device bandwidth limit
