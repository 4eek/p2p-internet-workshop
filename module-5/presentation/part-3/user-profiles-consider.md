Consider the following in your discussion

- What are the most used services by the user?
- How would the user be affected if internet access becomes unavailable?
  - What would the user consider as "internet went down"?
  - What is the threshold for the user? 
  - Packet loss / poor link quality
  - Latency / ping
  - Bandwidth speed
  - Bandwidth allotment
- Does network traffic trend change throughout the day for the user's connection?
- Look at your local internet provider (Bell, Rogers, etc.), which plan would you suggest for them and why?
- Does wired vs. wireless affect the experience?
