# Recap from last week

Using `Raspberry Pis`, we formed a `wireless mesh network` (week 1), we then learned more about `networks and the internet` (week 2), and `configuring wireless mesh networks` (week 3).

_This week we will start to think about scale and putting these networks out into the wild._
