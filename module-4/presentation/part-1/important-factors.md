# Important factors while planning

- Antenna types and characteristics
  - Transmit (TX) Power (dBm)
  - Gain (amplification based on shape)
  - Sensitivity or Received Signal Level (RSL)
  - Loss (distance, cable connections), attenuation (passing through objects), and scattering (dispersal)
- Noise and obstructions
