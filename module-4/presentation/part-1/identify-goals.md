# Identify Goals

Key questions:

- How will the network be used? what will it accomplish?
  - Detail specific applications or "use cases" (helps understand capacity)
- In one area, how many people do you expect to be on on the network? (helps understand link speed "budget", select hardware)
  - Assessment based on surveying needs
  - Calculations using link planning software (e.g., RadioMobile)
  - Trial and error!
- _others?_
