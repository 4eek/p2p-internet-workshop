# Who runs this?

This workshop series is presented by [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net), a group of volunteers using off-the-shelf hardware and peer-to-peer software to build a community mesh network. Over the course of six workshops, we will:

- Learn how to build and maintain mesh networks
- Familiarize with peer-to-peer applications and their values vs. centralized systems
- Reflect on the politics of our technologies and what a distributed web may bring

The syllabus, along with all course material is open-source and adapts resources from [Commotion Wireless](http://commotionwireless.net), [Meta Mesh](https://www.metamesh.org), [networks.land](http://networks.land), [(Re)Building Technology](http://communitytechnology.github.io/), among others.
