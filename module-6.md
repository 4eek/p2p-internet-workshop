## 1: Topic introduction



## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

### Objectives

Build a 900 MHz LoRa sensor network with WiFi mesh network as backhaul.

### Materials


### Format


### Activity

- Motivation to use low power networks:  
  * Energy, cost, simplicity  
  * Examples of low power networks by communities (eg. citizen science projects, resilient communication)

- Sending Information Wirelessly
  * Quick recap of Module 3 (Frequency, Amplitude, and Phase from Metamesh)
  * Modulation techniques - FM, AM, Chirp
  * How does LoRa work? What are some alternatives?
  * ISM band and spectrum allocation in Canada

- Low Power Microcontrollers
  * What is an Arduino?
  * Walk-through of a simple Arduino sketch to send data over LoRa to a friend

- Examples and discussion of use-cases

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity


## 4: Wrap-up and week ahead
