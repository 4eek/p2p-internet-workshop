# Radio and waves

Radio - the technology of using electromagnetic waves to carry information

## Properties of waves

### Frequency

* Measured in Hertz (Hz), or cycles per second
* We tune the radio to hear other people on the same frequency

### Amplitude

* How much power the wave has
* How loud we are talking

### Polarity

* Which direction is the wave cycling
* Orientation of the antenna is important

### Phase

* The offset of peaks and valleys of two waves
* You add the values at each point to calculate the new amplitude
  * Two peeks or valleys - wave has double the amplitude
  * A peek and a valley - amplitude closer to zero
* Interference happens when waves bounce off walls

### Channel width

* Defines how wide of a frequency band does the signal take up
* Larger channel width:
  * Provides more frequencies
  * Allows for more data to be sent at once
  * Is more susceptible to mode noise

## Frequencies and channels

Channels - human defined numbers that point to a specific frequency

* There are 13 channels defined for WiFi
* In Canada we can only use the first 11
* First channel starts at 2.412 GHz (or 2,412 MHz)
* The channels are spaced out by 5 MHz
* Standard WiFi signals use a channel width of 20 Mhz
* There are only 3 non-overlapping signals in the 2.4 GHz range (1, 6, and 11)

## Licensing

* There are many frequencies coexisting in the air
* Most of them are designated to a specific function
* Government agency tasked with controlling them in Canada is the CRTC
* 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz do not require any licensing
* Used by many devices, such as microwave ovens, not just WiFi devices
* They look like noise to WiFi devices
