# Radio and Radio Waves

Radio - the technology of using electromagnetic waves to carry information

## Properties of waves

### Frequency
* Measured in Hz (Hertz) or Cycles per second
* We tune the radio to hear other people on the same frequency
### Amplitude
* How much power the wave has
* How loud we are talking
### Polarity
* Which direction is the wave cycling
* Orientation of the antenna is important
### Phase
* The offset of peaks and valleys of two waves
* You add the values at each point to calculate the new amplitude
 * Two peeks or valleys - wave is twice as amplitude
 * A peek and a valley - amplitude closer to 0
* Happens when waves bounce of walls

### Channel Width 
* Defines how many frequencies does the signal take up
* Larger channel width provides
 * more frequencies
 * allows for more data to be sent at once
 * susceptible to mode noise

## Frequency and Channels

Channels are human defined numbers that point to a specific frequency 

* There are 13 channels defined for WiFi
* In Canada we can only use the first 11
* First channel starts at 2.412 GHz or 2,412 MHz
* The channels are spaced out by 5 MHz
* Standard WiFi signals use a channel width of 20Mhz
* There are only 3 non overlapping signals in 2.4 GHz range 1,6 and 11

## Licensing

* There are many frequencies that exist in the air
* Most of them are designated to a specific function
* Government agency tasked with controlling them in Canada is the CRTC
* 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz do not require any licensing
* Used by many devices not just WiFi
* They look like noise to WiFi
