## 1: Network Deployment Planning

### Objectives

- List features of a wifi/mesh deployment
- Explain and summarized important factors to consider for deployment

### Materials

- Class Presentation
- Class Shared Notes (i.e., using Riseup Pad or something similar)

### Steps

- Presentation on Deployment (8mins)
- Planning Considerations Activity (8mins)
  1. Split into groups/pairs
  2. Assign each group a case from [WNDW](http://wndw.net/caseStudies.html) (5 exist)
  3. Ask the groups to read through the cases, identify aspects to keep in mind when planning and present a summary to the group of what they anticipate
  4. Collect responses on in class shared notes and discuss

## 2: Mapping the Fort York Micro Mesh

### Objectives

- Sketch out and prototype an imagined Fort York Micro Mesh

### Materials

- Printed map (previous class confirm location. Ask if people live nearby, <10mins walk) and would be up for using their home)
- Google Earth
- Hardware examples

### Steps

- Introduce Group Mapping Exercise 
  - based on [Commotion Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/): "[Every Network Tells a Story](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/)"
  - Describe Routers and Rules
- Group Mapping 
- Discussion, Show & Tell

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity

- Ask group to review planning considerations in light of the mapping activity
  - Have someone as note-taker update the original list
- Review the 3 other planning activities in the Commotion Construction Kit](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/): [Survey your Neighbors](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/survey-your-neighbors/), [Identify Neighbourhood Skills](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/identify-neighborhood-skills/), [Inventory your Neighbourhood](https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/inventory-the-neighborhood/)
- With remaining time jointly brainstorm an Outreach Strategy for Toronto Mesh, starting in their neighbourhood
  - Have someone as note-taker add to class shared notes
