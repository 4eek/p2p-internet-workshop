# Setup Instructions

To participate in the workshop, you will need access to the software described below. You will also need an up-to-date web browser.

## SSH Client

You will need access to an SSH client to use during the workshop to perform tasks. Please familiarize yourself with where to find it in your operating system (instruction below).  

### Windows

Windows does not come with an SSH client. You will need to download one to use during the workshop.  A popular one is called PuTTY. To get PuTTY follow these steps.

1. Download PuTTY from https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe</a>.

2. Place the downloaded file on your desktop for easy access.

### macOS

On macOS there is a built in SSH client you can access from your Terminal. You can find the Terminal by opening your Applications folder, then opening the Utilities folder. The Terminal application will be amongst the icons there. You may want to add this to your dock.

### Linux

On Linux there is a built in SSH client you can access from your Terminal. Linux has many ways to access the terminal.  If your distribution has a search function (like UBUNTU) look for one of these keywords: terminal, xterm, uxterm.
