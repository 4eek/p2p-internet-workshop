# LoRa decoded

LoRa can achieve such great distances with such low power because it is not very susceptible to noise. LoRa works remarkably well with low signal strength.

LoRa uses *Chirp Spread Spectrum Modulation*, ie. the information is encoded in the shifts of increasing or decreasing frequency.
