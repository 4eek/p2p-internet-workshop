# Need for network literacy

Although these technologies can be immensely useful for sensing and automation there is concern about:

## Security

IoT device manufacturers have followed notoriously bad security hygiene. The 2016 Mirai Botnet DDoS attack exploited thousands of vulnerable internet connected CCTV cameras to take down DNS servers

## Surveillance

Ubiquitous sensing in our environments raises concern about who has access to sensed data and what they may do with it

## Resilience

As we become dependent on internet connected devices we need to ensure we have access to alternatives during failure
