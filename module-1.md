    - two minutes on community mesh networks in North America and other parts of the world
    - general landscape of technologies like flashing routers with OpenWrt to install some mesh routing software
- Set realistic expectations of the state of mesh technology

## 2: Hands-on and material exploration

- Activity for audience to "run their own app" on pre-configured nodes, where the apps are relatable with those we are familiar with from the Internet (e.g. Facebook, Dropbox, Whatsapp, Twitter, Spotify)
- See [Portable Network Kit](http://pnkgo.com) for types of services they run on a Raspberry Pi

## 3: Discussion and reflection activity
